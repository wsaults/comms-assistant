Check Slack for any mentions of me from the last 2 hours.

For each mention found:
1. Tell me who mentioned me
2. Which channel it was in
3. What they said
4. Whether it looks like a question that needs a response

If there are technical questions:
- Search my codebase for relevant information
- Draft helpful responses
- Ask me if I want to post them

Use the Slack MCP tools to search and post messages.
